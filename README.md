# treebandit
Bandit algorithm for tree search in online experiment

TODO: <br />
1. Testing pure algorithm in flat bandit arms <br />
2. Generate the tree class <= put in the tree structure (smoothness property) <br />
3. Apply the pure exploration algorithm to tree structure <br />
4. Compare flat and tree structure algorithm <br />
5. Report: Algorithm <br />
           Comparation <br />
